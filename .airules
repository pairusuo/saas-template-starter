# AI Assistant Rules for SaaS Template Starter

## Code Management Rules

### Git Operations
- **Never commit code automatically**: AI should not run `git commit` or `git push` commands without explicit user instruction
- **Commit message language**: All commit messages must be written in English, not Chinese
- **User control**: Let the user review changes and commit manually when they are satisfied

### Development Workflow
- **Make changes only**: AI should focus on making code changes, file modifications, and fixes
- **Present results**: Show what has been changed and let user decide when to commit
- **No automatic deployment**: Avoid automatic CI/CD operations or deployments

## Example Workflow
1. AI makes requested changes to code
2. AI reports what was changed
3. User reviews the changes
4. User manually commits with appropriate English commit message
5. User pushes to repository when ready

## Commit Message Format
- Use conventional commits format: `type: description`
- Examples:
  - `feat: add new landing page component`
  - `fix: resolve internationalization issues`
  - `chore: update dependencies`
  - `docs: update README documentation`

- Focus on code quality and user control over version control
